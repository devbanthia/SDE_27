Exhibit   GRANTORS REPURCHASE RIGHTS   1. C In addition to any and all other remedies available to Grantor at law or in equity, from and after the date of the Closing, Grantor reserves and shall have the right (the Completion Repurchase Right) to repurchase the Property if Grantee commences construction of a Residence on the Property, which shal] be deemed! to occur on the date the first pier shaft for the foundation of the Residence is drilled and filled, in whole or in part, with concrete (Commencement of Construction), and then fails to complete construction of the Residence on the Property within eighteen (18) months after the Commencement of Construction. The repurchase price shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the purchase price paid for the Property to Grantor by Grantee less any taxes and assessments unpaid as of the date of such repurchase, plus the actual out-of- pocket hard construction costs paid by Grantee for labor and materials to build the Residence on the Property exclusive of any and all soft costs. Soft costs means and refers to any and all costs incurred for architectural, design, studies, surveys, permits, loans, insurance, taxes, purchase or rental of equipment and tools, accounting, project management, advertising, marketing, legal and any other fees that are not direct hard construction costs for the Residence on the Property. The Completion Repurchase Right is to be exercised by written notice to Grantee within twenty-four (24) months after Commencement of Construction, or it shall automatically terminate, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by Grantor and Purchaser. Closing of such repurchase transaction shall be completed within thirty (30) days from the date of Grantor's notice to Grantee of its election to exercise the Completion Repurchase Right. The Completion Repurchase Right shall automatically terminate upon completion of the residence on the Property.   In addition to any and all other remedies available to Grantor at law or in equity, from and after the date of the Closing, Grantor reserves and shall have the right of first refusal (the Right of First Refusal) as to the Property as follows: If Grantee desires to sell the Property before Commencement of Construction of a Residence on the Property, Grantee shall first give written notice of the proposed sale of the Property to Grantor, which notice shall specify: (i) the identity of the party to whom Grantee proposes to sell the Property, (ii) the price, terms, and any conditions of the proposed sale of the Property, and (iii) an offer by Grantee to sell the Property to Grantor at a purchase price equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the purchase price paid for the Property by Grantee to Grantor less any taxes and assessments unpaid as of the date of Grantee's notice to Grantor. During the thirty (30) days following Grantor's receipt of notice of a proposed sale of the Property, Grantee shall neither sell nor agree to sel] the Property except to Grantor and Grantor shall have the exclusive option to purchase the Property. Grantor may exercise its Right of First Refusal by written notice delivered to Grantee before 5:00 p.m. on the last day of the thirty (30)-day exclusive option period, after which date the Right of First Refusal shall terminate. The Right of First Refusal shall automatically terminate upon Commencement of Construction of a Residence on the Property as provided herein.   The Completion Repurchase Right, and the Right of First Refusal are hereinafter collectively referred to as Grantors Repurchase Rights. If Grantee executes a deed of trust to secure a loan made to Buyer in connection with the purchase and/or construction of the   residence on the Property and the beneficiary of such deed of trust (the Mortgagee) gives notice to Grantor of the name and identity of such Mortgagee, then in such event and at any time Grantor considers that Buyer is in default under any of Grantors Repurchase Rights, Grantor shall give written notice thereof to Mortgagee at the address furnished, and Mortgagee shall thereupon have a reasonable time within which to foreclose its lien and acquire title to, and possession of, the Property, and Mortgagee shall further have a reasonable time within which to comply with the provisions herein. While Mortgagee is attempting in good faith to accomplish the foregoing, Grantor shall not exercise any of Grantor's Repurchase Rights; provided, however, that if Mortgagee fails to comply with the foregoing obligation then Grantor shall have the option to exercise Grantor's Repurchase Rights. The portion of the repurchase price to be paid to such Mortgagee hereunder shall be the amount theretofore advanced by Mortgagee on said loan to the extent that such amount has been applied to the purchase of the Property and/or the cost of improvements either completed or then under construction upon the Property. together with sums, if any, advanced by Mortgagee to pay taxes, insurance premiums, mechanic's liens, attorney's fees, trustee's fees, and other fees and expenses in connection with the acquisition, construction, development, operation, and preservation of the Property, together with interest on all such sums as provided in the documents evidencing such loan. Said amount advanced by Mortgagee, as described in the preceding sentence, shall be delivered to Mortgagee and, upon receipt thereof, Mortgagee shall release the deed of trust and any other instruments securing payment of the loan, and the remainder of the repurchase price (if any) shall be paid to Grantee.   Closing of any of the repurchase transactions described above shall be accomplished by Grantee's reconveyance of the Property to Grantor, its successors and assigns, by special warranty deed, free and clear of any liens and encumbrances other than those encumbrances existing on the date of this conveyance. In the event that Grantor should exercise its right to repurchase, then upon revestment of title in Grantor, all covenants, conditions, restrictions, and reservations imposed by Grantor herein shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect.   Grantor hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Right of First Refusal hereby reserved does not and shall not in any manner pertain or apply to the execution or delivery of any deed of trust and security agreement or any other writings securing any note against the Property or any foreclosure sale (whether judicial or non-judicial) of the Property or any proceeding or act in any manner connected with any such foreclosure sale. Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the termination of the Completion Repurchase Right or the Right of First Refusal, Grantor, its successors and assigns, shall execute and deliver to Grantee, its successors or assigns, a recordable affidavit confirming that the condition precedent to the termination of any such rights has occurred and confirming that Grantor and its successors and assigns have no further rights or interest in the Property under the applicable provision. Should Grantor or its successors and assigns fail to execute such an affidavit within thirty (30) days following Grantee's, or its successors and assigns', written request for such affidavit, Grantee and its successors and assigns may execute and record an affidavit to the same effect and such affidavit shall be conclusive and binding upon Grantor and its successors and assigns as to the facts stated therein.   6. Grantees obligations under Paragraphs | to complete construction within the timeframes set forth therein are subject to delays due to force majeure, including, without limitation, inability to obtain permits or utility services from the City; provided, however, that Grantee must deliver written notice to Grantor on or before the 5th calendar day of each month designating each and every day from the previous month it claims directly or indirectly caused or may cause a delay (Delay Notice) in the commencement date or completion date. Should Grantee fail to provide a timely Delay Notice on or before the 5\" day of any given month, Grantee waives the right to claim any delay days for the previous month, including, but not limited to, delay days that otherwise may have been due to force majeure.   7. The provisions in this Exhibit C shall be deemed covenants running with the land and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Grantor and Grantee and their respective legal representatives, heirs, executors. administrators, successors, and assigns.

WITNESSETH:   THAT Grantor, for and in consideration of the sum of Ten and No/100 Dollars ($10.00), and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, by these presents does grant, bargain and sell unto Grantee, and Grantees heirs, successors and assigns forever, all the right, title, interest, claim and demand that Grantor has in and to the following described real property (the Property) located and situated in the County of Miami-Dade, State of Florida, to wit:   Lot 9, in Block 27, of ENCLAVE SOUTH PHASE 2, according to the plat thereof, as recorded in Plat Book 175, Page 83, of the Public Records of Miami - Dade County, Florida.

The requirements of Chapter 558 of the Florida Statutes (2016) as it may be renumbered and/or amended from time to time.   _ E. Grantor and Grantee specifically agree that this transaction involves interstate commerce and that any Dispute (as hereinafter defined) shall first be submitted to mediation and, if not settled during mediation, shall thereafter be submitted to binding arbitration as provided by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) and not by or in a court of law or equity. Disputes (whether contract, warranty, tort, statutory or otherwise) shall include, but are not limited to, any and all controversies, disputes or claims (1) arising under, or related to, this Deed, the underlying purchase agreement for the sale and conveyance of the Property, the Property, the community in which the Property is located, or any dealings between Grantee and Grantor; (2) arising by virtue of any representations, promises or warranties alleged to have been made by Grantor or Grantor's representative; (3) relating to personal injury or property damage alleged to have been sustained by Grantee, Grantees children or other occupants of the Property, or in the community in which the Property is located; or (4) issues of formation, validity or enforceability of this Section. Grantee has accepted this Deed on behalf of his or her children and other occupants of the Property with the intent that all such parties be bound hereby. Any Dispute shall be submitted for binding arbitration within a reasonable time after such Dispute has arisen. Nothing herein shall extend the time period by which a claim or cause of action may be asserted under the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose, and in no event shall the dispute be submitted for arbitration after the date when institution of a legal or equitable proceeding based on the underlying claims in such Dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose.   (1) Any and all mediations commenced by Grantor or Grantee shall be filed with and administered by the American Arbitration Association or any successor thereto (AAA) in accordance with the AAAs Home Construction Mediation Procedures in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction   CFN: 20220268549 BOOK 33103 PAGE 2642   Mediation Procedures currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Mediation Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. Any party who will be relying upon an expert report or repair estimate at the mediation shall provide the mediator and the other parties with a copy of the reports. If one or more issues directly or indirectly relate to alleged deficiencies in design, materials or construction, all parties and their experts shall be allowed to inspect, document (by photograph, videotape or otherwise) and test the alleged deficiencies prior to mediation. Unless mutually waived in writing by the Grantor and Grantee, submission to mediation is a condition precedent to either party taking further action with regard to any matter covered hereunder.   (2) If the Dispute is not fully resolved by mediation, the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration and administered by the AAA in accordance with the AAAs Home Construction Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction Arbitration Rules currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over such Dispute. If the claimed amount exceeds $250,000.00 or includes a demand for punitive damages, the Dispute shall be heard and determined by three arbitrators; however, if mutually agreed to by the parties, then the Dispute shall be heard and determined by one arbitrator. Arbitrators shall have expertise in the area(s) of Dispute, which may include legal expertise if legal issues are involved. All decisions respecting the arbitrability of any Dispute shall be decided by the arbitrator(s). At the request of any party, the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be required by law or for confirmation of an award, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both Grantor and Grantee.   (3) The waiver or invalidity of any portion of this Section E shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of Section E of the Deed. Grantee and Grantor further agree (1) that any Dispute involving Grantor's affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents shall also be subject to mediation and arbitration as set forth herein, and shall not be pursued in a court of law or equity; (2) that Grantor may, at its sole election, include Grantor's contractors, subcontractors and suppliers, as well as any warranty company and insurer as parties in the mediation and arbitration; and (3) that the mediation and arbitration will be limited to the parties specified herein.   (4) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor and Grantee agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder unless there is mutuality of parties. In addition, Grantor and Grantee further agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any arbitration hereunder shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding unless there is mutuality of parties.   (5) Unless otherwise recoverable by law or statute, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and paraprofessional fees, for any mediation and arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party unsuccessfully contests the validity or scope of arbitration in a court of law or equity, the noncontesting party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in defending such contest, including such fees and costs associated with any appellate proceedings. In addition, if a party fails to abide by the terms of a mediation settlement or arbitration award, the other party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in enforcing such settlement or award.   (6) Grantee may obtain additional information concerning the rules of the AAA by visiting its website at www.adr.org or by writing the AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017.   (7) Grantor supports the principles set forth in the Consumer Due Process Protocol developed by the National Consumer Dispute Advisory Committee and agrees to the following:   (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of arbitration stated in Section E(2) of this Deed, Grantee shall have the option, after pursuing mediation as provided herein, to seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of the court's jurisdiction in lieu of proceeding to arbitration. This option does not apply to any appeal from a decision by a small claims court.   (b) Any mediator and associated administrative fees incurred shall be shared equally by Grantor and Grantee; however, Grantor and Grantee each agree to pay for their own attorneys fees and costs.   (c) The fees for any claim pursued via arbitration shall be apportioned as provided in the Home Construction Rules of the AAA or other applicable rules.   (8) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either Grantor or Grantee seeks injunctive relief, and not monetary damages, from a court because irreparable damage or harm would otherwise be suffered by either party before mediation or arbitration could be conducted, such actions shall not be interpreted to indicate that either party has waived the right to mediate or arbitrate. The right to mediate and arbitrate should also not be considered waived by the filing of a counterclaim by either party once a claim for injunctive relief had been filed with a court.   (9) GRANTOR AND GRANTEE AGREE THAT THE PARTIES MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN CLAIMS REGARDING MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTYS INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT BE AWARDED ON CLASS-WIDE OR MASS-PARTY BASIS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT PARTIES WHO ARE NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. NOTHING IN THE FOREGOING PREVENTS   CFN: 20220268549 BOOK 33103 PAGE 2643   GRANTOR FROM EXERCISING ITS RIGHT TO INCLUDE IN THE MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION THOSE PERSONS OR ENTITIES REFERRED TO IN SECTION E(3) ABOVE.   (10) THESE COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS (DEED RESTRICTIONS) REQUIRING ARBITRATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE DEED TO GRANTEE AND ARE MADE COVENANTS RUNNING WITH THE LAND IN PERPETUITY, BINDING UPON ALL SUBSEQUENT GRANTEES, PURCHASERS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

(v) If Grantor exercises the First Refusal Right by delivering written notice of such exercise to Grantee within the Response Period, Grantor and Grantee shall enter into the transaction described in, and upon the terms set forth in, the Grantee's Notice and the Disposition Document; provided, however, if the proposed Disposition is a conveyance of a fee simple interest in the Property or a portion thereof, the purchase price to be paid for the Property (or the portion thereof subject to Grantee's Notice) shall be the lesser of (i) the purchase price paid by Grantee in the conveyance of the Property from Grantor to Grantee or (11) the purchase price set forth in the Grantee's Notice.   (vi) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, the provisions of this Paragraph 2 shall not apply to a sale of all or any portion of the Property to an affiliate of Grantee; provided, however, the provisions of this Paragraph 2 shall survive such sale to an affiliate of Grantee, and the Property shall continue to be subject to the First Refusal Right.   (vii) Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, in the event: (i) Grantor does not elect to accept Grantee's offer, (ii) Grantee sells the Offered Property pursuant to the terms of this Exhibit \"C\", and (iii) Grantee retains a lien on the Offered Property   Special Warranty Deed Liberty Ph 5 / Perry 70   C-3 of 5   Repurchase Right and ROFR   and forecloses such lien, the First Refusal Right shall be automatically reinstated, and Grantee shall not consummate any further sale of the Offered Property without again complying with the terms of Paragraph 2.   (viii) The First Refusal Right shall not apply to any mortgage of the Property or any portion thereof to secure the repayment of borrowings by Grantee. A foreclosure sale by such lender shall not be a sale to which the First Refusal Right shall be applicable, but the Property shall continue to be subject to the First Refusal Right following such foreclosure sale, and any purchaser at such a foreclosure sale shall acquire the Property subject to the First Refusal Right. Grantor shall execute and deliver any instruments reasonably requested by Grantee to evidence the agreements of Grantor pursuant to this Exhibit \"C\".
