Grantor and Grantee specifically agree that this transaction involves interstate commerce and that any Dispute (as hereinafter defined) shall first be submitted to mediation and, if not settled during mediation, shall thereafter be submitted to binding arbitration as provided by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) and not by or in a court of law or equity (the \"Arbitration Provision\". \"Disputes\" (whether contract, warranty, tort, statutory or otherwise) shall include, but are not limited to, any and all controversies, disputes or claims (1) arising under, or related to, this Deed, the underlying purchase agreement for the sale and conveyance of the Property, the Property, the community in which the Property is located, the construction of improvements on the Property, or any dealings between Grantee and Grantor; (2) arising by virtue of any representations, promises or warranties alleged to have been made by Grantor or Grantor's representative; (3) relating to personal injury or property damage alleged to have been sustained by Grantee, Grantees children or other occupants of the Property, or in the community in which the Property is located; or (4) relating to issues of formation, validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision. Grantee has accepted this Deed for itself an on behalf of his or her children and other occupants of the Property with the intent that all such parties be bound hereby. Any Dispute shall be submitted for binding arbitration within a reasonable time after such Dispute has arisen. Nothing herein shall extend the time period by which a claim or cause of action may be asserted under the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose, and in no event shall the dispute be submitted for arbitration after the date when institution of a legal or equitable proceeding based on the underlying claims in such Dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose.   (1) lf the parties are unable to agree to a mediator, then any and all mediations commenced by Grantor or Grantee shall be filed with and administered by the American Arbitration Association or any successor thereto (\"AAA\") in accordance with the AAA's Home Construction Mediation Procedures in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction Mediation Procedures currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Mediation Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. Any party who will be relying upon an expert report or repair estimate at the mediation shall provide the mediator and the other parties with a copy of the reports. If one or more issues directly or indirectly relate to alleged deficiencies in design, materials or construction, all parties and their experts shall be allowed to inspect, document (by photograph, videotape or otherwise) and test the alleged deficiencies prior to mediation. Unless mutually waived in writing by the Grantor and Grantee, submission to mediation is a condition precedent to either party taking further action with regard to any matter covered hereunder.   (2) If the Dispute is not fully resolved by mediation, the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration and administered by the AAA in accordance with the AAA's Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. The decision of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on both parties. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over such Dispute. If the claimed amount exceeds $250,000.00 or includes a demand for punitive damages, the Dispute shall be heard and determined by three arbitrators; however, if mutually agreed to by the parties, then the Dispute shall be heard and determined by one arbitrator. Arbitrators shall have expertise in the area(s) of Dispute, which may include legal expertise if legal issues are involved. All decisions respecting the arbitrability of any Dispute shall be decided by the arbitrator(s). At the request of any party, the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be required by law or for confirmation of an award, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both Grantor and Grantee.   (3) The waiver or invalidity of any portion of this Exhibit \"A\" shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of Exhibit \"A\" of the Deed. Grantee and Grantor further agree (1) that any Dispute involving Grantor's affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents shall also be subject to mediation and arbitration as set forth herein, and shall not be pursued in a court of law or equity; (2) that Grantor may, at its sole election, include Grantor's contractors, subcontractors   Page 3 135700-002963   and suppliers, as well as any warranty company and insurer as parties in the mediation and arbitration; and (3) that the mediation and arbitration will be limited to the parties specified herein.   (4) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor and Grantee agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder unless there is mutuality of parties. In addition, Grantor and Grantee further agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any arbitration hereunder shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding unless there is mutuality of parties.   (5) Unless otherwise recoverable by law or statute, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and paraprofessional fees, for any mediation and arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party unsuccessfully contests the validity or scope of arbitration in a court of law or equity, the non-contesting party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in defending such contest, including such fees and costs associated with any appellate proceedings. In addition, if a party fails to abide by the terms of a mediation settlement or arbitration award, the other party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in enforcing such settlement or award.   (6) Grantee may obtain additional information concerning the rules of the AAA by visiting its website at www.adr.org or by writing the AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017.   (7) Grantor supports the principles set forth in the Consumer Due Process Protocol developed by the National Consumer Dispute Advisory Committee and agrees to the following:   a. Notwithstanding the requirements of arbitration stated in this Section of this Deed, Grantee shall have the option, after pursuing mediation as provided herein, to seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of the court's jurisdiction in lieu of proceeding to arbitration. This option does not apply to any appeal from a decision by a small claims court.   b, Grantor agrees to pay for one (1) day of mediation (mediator fees plus any administrative fees relating to the mediation).

Mold Disclaimer and Waiver. Molds, mildew, fungi, bacteria and microbiologic organisms (collectively, Molds) are present in soil, air and elgewhere in the environment. Molds can proliferate in various environments, including, among others, damp areas such as bathrooms and within walls and partitions. Certain parties have expressed concerns about the possible adverse effects on human health from exposure to Molds. Due to various reasons, including the varying sensitivities of different individuals to various types of Molds and other contaminants, there currently exist no state or federal standards regarding acceptable levels of exposure ta Molds. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Lung Association, some diseases or illnesses have been linked with biological pollutants in the indoor environment, including some forms of Mold. However, it is believed that many of these conditions may also have causes unreiated to the indoor environment. Therefore, it is presently unknown how many potential health problems relate primarily or exclusively to indoor air quality or Molds. Grantee is advised that Grantor is not qualified and has not undertaken to evaluate all aspects of this very complex issue. GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT GRANTOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING, THE PAST, CURRENT OR FUTURE, PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF MOLDS IN OR IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROPERTY AND THAT THE LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED BY GRANTOR TO GRANTEE (THE WARRANTY) SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES FROM COVERAGE THE PRESENCE OF MOLD IN THE PROPERTY, REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OR CAUSE, ALL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Grantor recommends that Grantee, at Grantees expense, conduci its own investigation and consult with such experts as Grantee deems appropriate regarding the occurrence and effects of Molds, the [potential sensitivity or special risk Grantee, his or her family members, and other individuals who will occupy or use the Property may have with respect to Molds, and methods to reduce or limit Molds within the Property.   When excessive moisture or water accumulates indoors, Moid growth can and will occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains unaddressed. There is no practical way to eliminate all Mold in an indoor environment. The key to controlling indoor Mold growth is to control moisture. Grantee agrees to maintaih the Property in such a manner as to reduce the potential for increased Mold formation or growth, including, without limitation, keeping dryer and other vents and/or fans clear and functioning, and preventing and repairing plumbing, window and other leaks and sources of moisture. Grantee agrees to make periodic inspections of the Property after closing for the presence of Molds or conditions which may increase the ability of Molds to propagate within the Property, and to monitor the Property on a continual basis for excessive moisture, water or Mold accumulation, If water or moisture is discovered in or around the Property, Grantee should immediately seek to eliminate the: source of the water or moisture. Failure to eliminate the source of moisture could result in additional damage and the growth of Mold. Plumbing teaks and water penetrations that are covered by the Warranty during the term of the Warranty must be reported to Grantor immediately. If the Warranty Las expired or the Warranty dees not cover the specific problem, Grantee should not delay in having professionals address the problem. Grantor will not be responsible for damages, Grantee hereby waives all rights to damages and subrogation of damages, and Grantee agrees to indemnify Grantor and hold Grantor harmiess from damages, including in all cases personal injury or property! damage, caused by the presence of Mold and/or water or moisture in the Property to the extent that the damages are caused by: (1} Grantees   negligence or failure to properly maintain and monitor the Property; (ii) Grantees failure to promptly take appropriate corrective measures and minimize any damage caused by water or moisture (including, without limitation, failure to promptly notify and engage the help of appropriate professionals); or (ii) Grantees failure to promptly notify Grantor of the water or moisture problem and to provide Grantor with an opportunity to dry the moisture or water, correct the source of the problem, and remediate, if necessary, any moisture conditions resulting from defects in workmanship and materials covered by the Warranty.   TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GRANTOR WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES AND GRANTEE HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO DAMAGES AND SUBROGATION OF DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF MOLD IN THE PROPERTY, | REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OR CAUSE. GRANTEE AGREES TO INDEMNIFY GRANTOR AND HOLD GRANTOR HARMLESS FROM DAMAGES, INCLUDING IN ALL CASES PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF MOLD IN THE PROPERTY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES ARE CAUSED BY: (1) GRANTEES NEGLIGENCE OR FAILURE TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN AND MONITOR THE PROPERTY; (1) GRANTEES FAILURE TO PROMPTLY TAKE APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND MINIMIZE ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY WATER OR MOISTURE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FAILURE TO PROMPTLY NOTIFY AND ENGAGE THE HELP OF APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONALS}; OR CI) GRANTEES FAULURE TO PROMPTLY NOTIFY GRANTOR OF THE WATER OR MOISTURE PROBLEM AND TO PROVIDE GRANTOR WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRY THE MOISTURE OR WATER, CORRECT THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM, AND REMEDIATE, If NECESSARY, ANY MOISTURE CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM DEFECTS IN WORKMANSHIP AND MATERIALS COVERED BY THE WARRANTY. _   7.

Industrial Activities.The Lot is located in an area that Is industrial in nature and can be expected to generate visible, audible and odorous impacts and disturbances from industrial activities (\"Industrial Activities\"). By way of example, the Lot is located near a gravel pit and asphalt plant that produce odors and loud noises. 2. Construction Activities. The Lot is located in an area that is subject to or near ongoing construction activities (collectively, the Construction Activities). The Construction Activities are expected to generate an unpredictable amount of visible, audible and odorous impacts and disturbances. The Construction Activities may include, without limitation: (a) construction traffic (including, without limitation, construction vehicles, equipment and vehicles used or owned by Grantor, its affiliates, adjacent landowners, and the employees, agents and contractors of any of them;) and (b) construction activities (including, without limitation, grading, excavation, clearing, site work, relocation of roadways and public utilities, and construction of improvements) relating to the planned community known as Summit Sky Ranch (the Project) or nearby properties. 3. Waiver and Release. Grantee acknowledges that the Industrial Activities and the Construction Activities may occur in and around the Lot and the Project, may occur in the daytime and nighttime, and may be temporarily or permanently interrupted, discontinued or modified, in whole or in part, from time to time. Grantee forever waives and releases any claims Grantee, its successors and assigns may have against Grantor, its affiliates and their successors and assigns, which in any way arise out of the impacts and disturbances generated from the Industrial Activities or the Construction Activities. 4. No View Easement. Notwithstanding any oral, written or other representation made to Grantee to the contrary by Grantor, any real estate agency or agent, or any agent, employee, or representative of Grantor, or any other person, Grantee hereby acknowledges and agrees that there is no easement or other right, express or implied, for the benefit of Grantee or the Lot for light, view, or air included in or created by this Special Warranty Deed or as a result of Grantee's owning the Lot. Grantee, by taking title to the Lot, hereby acknowledges and agrees that any view, sight lines, or openings for light or air available from the Lot or the Project may be blocked in whole or in part in the future by virtue of natural or unnatural causes, including but not limited to future construction or expansion of commercial or residential buildings or facilities, natural growth of vegetation or natural or unnatural loss or alteration of vegetation.

GRANTEE HEREBY ACCEPTS SUCH DISCLAIMER, AND AGREES THAT GRANTOR AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY FOR, AND WAIVES ANY CLAIM AGAINST GRANTOR OR ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR CONTRACTORS OR AGENTS, RELATED TO ANY LOSS OF LIGHT, AIR, OR VIEW THAT MAY AFFECT THE LOT OR THE PROJECT.  _   When recorded return to: ERNEST CHUNG DITSHROLA SANE LOUIEVILLE e2-2008% 7 77 O Aran aVvog eA ute 132-5 86 20202378 | {HOUTA Ui HALT HLT (100086715) Lafayette Co 00 26   Form 1009 closing/deeds/wd_skyranch.html   5. Other Properties Grantee acknowledges that other properties are located adjacent to and in the general vicinity of the Project (the \"Other Properties\") and that the Other Properties may be developed pursuant to the land uses permitted by the zoning ordinances of the Town of Silverthorne (the \"Town\"), as well as any other governmental rules, regulations, or policies in effect now or in the future which are applicable to the Other Properties, as may be amended from time to time (collectively, the \"Ordinances\"). Neither Grantor nor Grantor's employees, agents, officers, directors and affiliates make any representations concerning the planned uses of the Other Properties. Grantee further acknowledges that the zoning for the Project and the Other Properties is established and governed by the Ordinances. Any amendment of those Ordinances, requires approval of the Town. Grantee acknowledges that Grantee has not relied upon any statements or representations regarding the Project, the Lot or the Other Properties, including, without limitation, any representations made by Grantor or any agents or employees of Grantor or any real estate agency or any agent, except for those statements and representations expressly set forth in the Ordinances and in the purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Grantor agreed to sell and convey the Lot to Grantee. 6. Mold Disclaimer and Waiver.6. Molds, mildew, fungi, bacteria and microbiologic organisms (collectively, \"Molds\") are present in soil, air and elsewhere in the environment. Molds can proliferate in various environments, including, among others, damp areas such as bathrooms and within walls and partitions. Certain parties have expressed concerns about the possible adverse effects on human health from exposure to Molds. Due to various reasons, including the varying sensitivities of different individuals to various types of Molds and other contaminants, there currently exist no state or federal standards regarding acceptable levels of exposure to Molds. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Lung Association, some diseases or ilinesses have been linked with biological pollutants in the indoor environment, including some forms of Mold. However, it is believed that many of these conditions may also have causes unrelated to the indoor environment. Therefore, it is presently unknown how many potential health problems relate primarily or exclusively to indoor air quality or Molds. Grantee is advised that Grantor is not qualified and has not undertaken to evaluate all aspects of this very complex issue. GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT GRANTOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING, THE PAST, CURRENT OR FUTURE, PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF MOLDS IN OR IN THE VICINITY OF THE LOT OR IN ANY OTHER PORTION OF THE PROJECT AND THAT THE LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED BY GRANTOR TO GRANTEE (THE \"WARRANTY\") SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES FROM COVERAGE THE PRESENCE OF MOLD IN THE LOT AND THE PROJECT, REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OR CAUSE, ALL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Grantor recommends that Grantee, at Grantee's expense, conduct its own investigation and consult with such experts as Grantee deems appropriate regarding the occurrence and effects of Molds, the potential sensitivity or special risk Grantee, his or her family members, and other individuals who will occupy or use the Lot may have with respect to Molds, and methods to reduce or limit Molds within the Lot.   When excessive-moisture or water accumulates indoors, Mold growth can and will occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains unaddressed. There is no practical way to eliminate all Mold in an indoor environment. The key to controlling indoor Mold growth is to control moisture. Grantee agrees to maintain the Lot in such a manner as to reduce the potential for increased Mold formation or growth, including, without limitation, keeping dryer and other vents and fans clear and functioning, and preventing and repairing plumbing, window and other leaks and sources of moisture. Grantee agrees to make periodic inspections of the Lot after clasing for the presence of Molds or conditions which may increase the ability of Molds to propagate within the Lot, and to monitor the Lot on a continual basis for excessive moisture, water or Mold accumulation. If water or moisture is discovered in or around the Lot, Grantee should immediately seek to eliminate the source of the water or moisture. Failure to eliminate the source of moisture could result in additional damage and the growth of Mold. Plumbing leaks and water penetrations that are covered by the Warranty during the term of the Warranty must be reported to Grantor immediately. If the Warranty has expired or the Warranty does not cover the specific problem, Grantee should not delay in having professionals address the problem. Grantor will not be responsible for damages, Grantee hereby waives all rights to damages and subrogation of damages, and Grantee agrees to indemnify Grantor and hoid Grantor harmless from damages, including in all cases personal injury or property damage, caused by the presence of Mold or water or moisture in the Lot or other portions of the Project to the extent that the damages are caused by: (i) Grantee's negligence or failure to properly maintain and monitor the Lot; (ii) Grantee's failure to promptly take appropriate corrective measures and minimize any damage caused by water or moisture (including, without limitation, failure to promptly notify and engage the heip of appropriate professionals); or (iii) Grantee's failure to promptly notify Grantor of the water or moisture problem and to provide Grantor with an opportunity to dry the moisture or water, correct the source of the problem, and remediate, if necessary, any moisture conditions resulting from defects in workmanship and materials covered by the Warranty.   TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, GRANTOR WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES AND GRANTEE HEREBY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO DAMAGES AND SUBROGATION OF DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF MOLD IN THE LOT OR THE PROJECT, REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OR CAUSE. GRANTEE AGREES TO INDEMNIFY GRANTOR AND HOLD GRANTOR HARMLESS FROM DAMAGES, INCLUDING IN ALL CASES PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OF MOLD IN THE LOT OR THE PRQJECT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE DAMAGES ARE CAUSED BY: (I) GRANTEES NEGLIGENCE OR FAILURE TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN AND MONITOR THE LOT; (il) GRANTEE'S FAILURE TO PROMPTLY TAKE APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE MEASURES AND MINIMIZE ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY WATER OR MOISTURE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FAILURE TO PROMPTLY NOTIFY AND ENGAGE THE HELP OF APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONALS); OR (I!) GRANTEE'S FAILURE TO PROMPTLY NOTIFY GRANTOR OF THE WATER OR MOISTURE PROBLEM AND TO PROVIDE GRANTOR WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRY THE MOISTURE OR WATER, CORRECT THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM, AND REMEDIATE, IF NECESSARY, ANY MOISTURE CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM DEFECTS IN WORKMANSHIP AND MATERIALS COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.   7. Geologic Hazards Pubiic notice is hereby given that a portion or all of the Project contains tandslide and slope instability hazards with potential for ground movement that could result in damage to foundations, structures, buried utilities, concrete flatwork, pavements and other improvements (the Geologic Hazards). Grantor has made modifications or is in the process of making modifications to the land on which the Project will be constructed to stabilize the soil and provide sufficient drainage, as required by the Town. Surface   20202378 (100086715)   Form 1009 closing/deeds/wd_skyranch.html!   swales, interceptor, underdrains and horizontal drains will be required as part of the improvements in order to control subsurface and surface flows through the Project and to stabilize existing slopes. Fill may be placed on lots during development of the Project to meet Town standard grading requirements. Such fill will be placed on the lots at Grantor's expense prior to sale of the lots. Surface and subsurface water will require underground drains to de-water cut slopes near certain lots. Further information on the stabilization and drainage requirements are set forth in that certain Soils Report, prepared by Wright Water Engineers, dated February, 2008, as supplemented by that Engineering Analytics Geotechnical Study dated March, 2015, on file at the Town. By taking title to the Lot, Grantee acknowledges having had the opportunity to review a copy of the Soils Reports and that Grantee has no objections to the Soils Report. Grantor cannot and does not guarantee that no Geologic Hazards such as slope instability, landslides or ground movement will occur at the Project. Grantee hereby acknowledges that it has had the opportunity to consult with its own experts, insurance agents and contractors regarding the Geologic Hazards. By acquiring an interest in the Lot, Grantee acknowledges that the Geologic Hazards at the Project and the measures adopted by Grantor to address risk of Geologic Hazards are acceptable to Grantee. GRANTOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES CONCERNING GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AT THE PROJECT AS A RESULT OF THE GEOLOGIC HAZARDS. GRANTEE AGREES THAT GRANTOR AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT HAVE ANY OBLIGATION OR LIABILITY FOR, AND WAIVES ANY CLAIM AGAINST GRANTOR AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS, RELATED TO ANY GEOLOGIC HAZARDS AT THE PROJECT, INCLUDING ANY LIABILITY OR LOSS ARISING FROM ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE OR LOSSES, OR DEATH ARISING FROM OR ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OCCURRENCE OR PRESENCE OF GEOLOGIC HAZARDS, WHETHER AND WHENEVER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, OR SUSPECTED OR UNSUSPECTED, ALL TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. 8.

WITNESSETH:   THAT Grantor, for and in consideration of the sum of Ten and No/100 Dollars ($10.00), and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, by these presents does grant, bargain and sell unto Grantee, and Grantees heirs, successors and assigns forever, all the right, title, interest, claim and demand that Grantor has in and to the following described real property (the Property) located and situated in the County of Escambia, State of Florida, to wit:   Lot 38, in Block A, of KISSIMMEE POINTE, according to the Plat thereof, as recorded in Plat Book 20, Page 28, of the Public Records of Escambia County, Florida.   The Property is conveyed subject to the following:   A. Conditions, restrictions, limitations, reservations, easements and other agreements of record affecting the Property but this provision shall not operate to reimpose the same.   B. Real estate, ad valorem and non ad valorem taxes and all assessments by any community development, recreation, water control, water conservation, watershed improvement or special taxing districts (including, without limitation, the obligation to pay maintenance assessments and capital assessments) affecting the Property, for this and subsequent years not yet due and payable.   Cc. All covenants, conditions and restrictions contained in this Deed are equitable servitudes, perpetual and run with the land, including, without limitation, Sections D, E, F, and G.   D. The requirements of Chapter 558 of the Florida Statutes (2016) as it may be renumbered and/or amended from time to time.   E. Grantor and Grantee specifically agree that this transaction involves interstate commerce and that any Dispute (as hereinafter defined) shall first be submitted to mediation and, if not settled during mediation, shall thereafter be submitted to binding arbitration as provided by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) and not by or in a court of law or equity. Disputes (whether contract, warranty, tort, statutory or otherwise) shall include, but are not limited to, any and all controversies, disputes or claims (1) arising under, or related to, this Deed, the underlying purchase agreement for the sale and conveyance of the Property, the Property, the community in which the Property is located, or any dealings between Grantee and Grantor; (2) arising by virtue of any representations, promises or warranties alleged to have been made by Grantor or Grantors representative; (3) relating to personal injury or property damage alleged to have been sustained by Grantee, Grantee's children or other occupants of the Property, or in the community in which the Property is located; or (4) issues of formation, validity or enforceability of this Section. Grantee has accepted this Deed on behalf of his or her children and other occupants of the Property with the intent that all such parties be bound hereby. Any Dispute shall be submitted for binding arbitration within a reasonable time after such Dispute has arisen. Nothing herein shall extend the time period by which a claim or cause of action may be asserted under ihe applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose, and in no event shall the dispute be submitted for arbitration after the date when institution of a legal or equitable proceeding based on the underlying claims in such Dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose.   (1) Any and all mediations commenced by Grantor or Grantee shall be filed with and administered by the American Arbitration Association or any successor thereto (AAA) in accordance with the AAAs Home Construction Mediation Procedures in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction Mediation Procedures currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Mediation Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. Any party who will be relying upon an expert report or repair estimate at the   BK: 8822 PG: 1753   mediation shall provide the mediator and the other parties with a copy of the reports. If one or more issues directly or indirectly relate to alleged deficiencies in design, materials or construction, all parties and their experts shall be allowed to inspect, document (by photograph, videotape or otherwise) and test the alleged deficiencies prior to mediation. Unless mutually waived in writing by the Grantor and Grantee, submission to mediation is a condition precedent to either party taking further action with regard to any matter covered hereunder.   (2) If the Dispute is not fully resolved by mediation, the Dispute shail be submitted to binding arbitration and administered by the AAA in accordance with the AAAs Home Construction Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction Arbitration Rules currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of such request shail be utilized. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over such Dispute. If the claimed amount exceeds $250,000.00 or includes a demand for punitive damages, the Dispute shall be heard and determined by three arbitrators; however, if mutually agreed to by the parties, then the Dispute shall be heard and determined by one arbitrator. Arbitrators shall have expertise in the area(s) of Dispute, which may include legal expertise if legal issues are involved. All decisions respecting the arbitrability of any Dispute shall be decided by the arbitrator(s). At the request of any party, the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be required by law or for confirmation of an award, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both Grantor and Grantee.   (3) The waiver or invalidity of any portion of this Section E shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of Section E of the Deed. Grantee and Grantor further agree (1) that any Dispute involving Grantors affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents shall also be subject to mediation and arbitration as set forth herein, and shail not be pursued in a court of law or equity; (2) that Grantor may, at its sole election, include Grantors contractors, subcontractors and suppliers, as well as any warranty company and insurer as parties in the mediation and arbitration; and (3) that the mediation and arbitration will be limited to the parties specified herein.   (4) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor and Grantee agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder unless there is mutuality of parties. In addition, Grantor and Grantee further agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any arbitration hereunder shail be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding unless there is mutuality of parties.   (5) Unless otherwise recoverable by law or statute, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and paraprofessional fees, for any mediation and arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party unsuccessfully contests the validity or scope of arbitration in a court of law or equity, the noncontesting party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in defending such contest, including such fees and costs associated with any appellate proceedings. In addition, if a party fails to abide by the terms of a mediation settlement or arbitration award, the other party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in enforcing such settlement or award.   (6) Grantee may obtain additional information concerning the rules of the AAA by visiting its website at www.adr.org or by writing the AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017.   (7) Grantor supports the principles set forth in the Consumer Due Process Protocol developed by the National Consumer Dispute Advisory Committee and agrees to the following:   (a) Notwithstanding the requiremenis of arbitration stated in Section E(2) of this Deed, Grantee shall have the option, after pursuing mediation as provided herein, to seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of the courts jurisdiction in tieu of proceeding to arbitration. This option does not apply to any appeal from a decision by a small claims court.   (b) Any mediator and associated administrative fees incurred shall be shared equally by Grantor and Grantee; however, Grantor and Grantee each agree to pay for their own attorneys fees and costs.   (c) The fees for any claim pursued via arbitration shall be apportioned as provided in the Home Construction Rules of the AAA or other applicable rules.   (8) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either Grantor or Grantee seeks injunctive relief, and not monetary damages, from a court because irreparable damage or harm would otherwise be suffered by either party before mediation or arbitration could be conducted, such actions shall not be interpreted to indicate that either party has waived the right to mediate or arbitrate. The right to mediate and arbitrate should also not be considered waived by the filing of a counterclaim by either party once a claim for injunctive relief had been filed with a court.   (9) GRANTOR AND GRANTEE AGREE THAT THE PARTIES MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN CLAIMS REGARDING MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT BE AWARDED ON CLASS-WIDE OR MASS-PARTY BASIS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT PARTIES WHO ARE NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. NOTHING IN THE FOREGOING PREVENTS GRANTOR FROM EXERCISING ITS RIGHT TO INCLUDE IN THE MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION THOSE PERSONS OR ENTITIES REFERRED TO IN SECTION E(3) ABOVE.   BK: 8822 PG: 1754   (10) THESE COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS (\"DEED RESTRICTIONS) REQUIRING ARBITRATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE DEED TO GRANTEE AND ARE MADE COVENANTS RUNNING WITH THE LAND IN PERPETUITY, BINDING UPON ALL SUBSEQUENT GRANTEES, PURCHASERS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.   F. Notwithstanding the Grantor and Grantees obligation to submit any Dispute to mediation and arbitration, in the event that a particular dispute is not subject to the mediation or the arbitration provisions of Section E of this Deed, then the Grantor and Grantee agree to the following provisions: GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT JUSTICE WILL BEST BE SERVED IF ISSUES REGARDING THIS DEED ARE HEARD BY A JUDGE INA COURT PROCEEDING, AND NOT A JURY. GRANTEE AND GRANTOR AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE HEARD BY A JUDGE IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND NOT A JURY. GRANTEE AND GRANTOR HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.   G.

Grantee has accepted this Deed on behalf of his or her children and other occupants of the Property with the intent that all such parties be bound hereby. Any Dispute shall be submitted for binding arbitration within a reasonable time after such Dispute has arisen. Nothing herein shall extend the time period by which a claim or cause of action may be asserted under the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose, and in no event shall the dispute be submitted for arbitration after the date when institution of a legal or equitable proceeding based on the underlying claims in such Dispute would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations or statute of repose.   (1) Any and all mediations commenced by Grantor or Grantee shall be filed with and administered by the American Arbitration Association or any successor thereto (AAA) in accordance with the AAAs Home Construction Mediation Procedures in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction Mediation Procedures currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Mediation Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. Any party who will be relying upon an expert report or repair estimate at the   BK: 8822 PG: 1622   mediation shall provide the mediator and the other parties with a copy of the reports. If one or more issues directly or indirectly relate to alleged deficiencies in design, materials or construction, all parties and their experts shall be allowed to inspect, document (by photograph, videotape or otherwise) and test the alleged deficiencies prior to mediation. Unless mutually waived in writing by the Grantor and Grantee, submission to mediation is a condition precedent to either party taking further action with regard to any matter covered hereunder.   (2) If the Dispute is not fully resolved by mediation, the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration and administered by the AAA in accordance with the AAAs Home Construction Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of the request. If there are no Home Construction Arbitration Rules currently in effect, then the AAA's Construction Industry Arbitration Rules in effect on the date of such request shall be utilized. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction over such Dispute. If the claimed amount exceeds $250,000.00 or includes a demand for punitive damages, the Dispute shall be heard and determined by three arbitrators; however, if mutually agreed to by the parties, then the Dispute shall be heard and determined by one arbitrator. Arbitrators shall have expertise in the area(s) of Dispute, which may include legal expertise if legal issues are involved. All decisions respecting the arbitrability of any Dispute shail be decided by the arbitrator(s). At the request of any party, the award of the arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be required by law or for confirmation of an award, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both Grantor and Grantee.   (3) The waiver or invalidity of any portion of this Section E shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of Section E of the Deed. Grantee and Grantor further agree (1) that any Dispute involving Grantor's affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents shall also be subject to mediation and arbitration as set forth herein, and shall not be pursued in a court of law or equity; (2) that Grantor may, at its sole election, include Grantor's contractors, subcontractors and suppliers, as well as any warranty company and insurer as parties in the mediation and arbitration; and (3) that the mediation and arbitration will be limited to the parties specified herein.   (4) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Grantor and Grantee agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any arbitration hereunder unless there is mutuality of parties. In addition, Grantor and Grantee further agree that no finding or stipulation of fact, no conclusion of law, and no arbitration award in any arbitration hereunder shall be given preclusive or collateral estoppel effect in any other arbitration, judicial, or similar proceeding unless there is mutuality of parties.   (5) Unless otherwise recoverable by law or statute, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and paraprofessional fees, for any mediation and arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a party unsuccessfully contests the validity or scope of arbitration in a court of law or equity, the noncontesting party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in defending such contest, including such fees and costs associated with any appellate proceedings. In addition, if a party fails to abide by the terms of a mediation settlement or arbitration award, the other party shall be awarded reasonable attorneys fees, paraprofessional fees and expenses incurred in enforcing such settlement or award.   (6) Grantee may obtain additional information concerning the rules of the AAA by visiting its website at www.adr.org or by writing the AAA at 335 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10017.   (7) Grantor supports the principles set forth in the Consumer Due Process Protocol developed by the National Consumer Dispute Advisory Committee and agrees to the following:   (a) Notwithstanding the requirements of arbitration stated in Section E(2) of this Deed, Grantee shall have the option, after pursuing mediation as provided herein, to seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of the court's jurisdiction in lieu of proceeding to arbitration. This option does not apply to any appeal from a decision by a small claims court.   (b) Any mediator and associated administrative fees incurred shall be shared equally by Grantor and Grantee; however, Grantor and Grantee each agree to pay for their own attorneys fees and costs.   (c) The fees for any claim pursued via arbitration shall be apportioned as provided in the Home Construction Rules of the AAA or other applicable rules.   (8) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if either Grantor or Grantee seeks injunctive relief, and not monetary damages, from a court because irreparable damage or harm would otherwise be suffered by either party before mediation or arbitration could be conducted, such actions shall not be interpreted to indicate that either party has waived the right to mediate or arbitrate. The right to mediate and arbitrate should also not be considered waived by the filing of a counterclaim by either party once a claim for injunctive relief had been filed with a court.   (9) GRANTOR AND GRANTEE AGREE THAT THE PARTIES MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR COLLECTIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN CLAIMS REGARDING MORE THAN ONE PROPERTY AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT BE AWARDED ON CLASS-WIDE OR MASS-PARTY BASIS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT PARTIES WHO ARE NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. NOTHING IN THE FOREGOING PREVENTS GRANTOR FROM EXERCISING ITS RIGHT TO INCLUDE IN THE MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION THOSE PERSONS OR ENTITIES REFERRED TO IN SECTION E(3) ABOVE.   BK: 8822 PG: 1623   (10) THESE COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS (DEED RESTRICTIONS) REQUIRING ARBITRATION AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE DEED TO GRANTEE AND ARE MADE COVENANTS RUNNING WITH THE LAND IN PERPETUITY, BINDING UPON ALL SUBSEQUENT GRANTEES, PURCHASERS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.   F. Notwithstanding the Grantor and Grantees obligation to submit any Dispute to mediation and arbitration, in the event that a particular dispute is not subject to the mediation or the arbitration provisions of Section E of this Deed, then the Grantor and Grantee agree to the following provisions: GRANTEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT JUSTICE WILL BEST BE SERVED IF ISSUES REGARDING THIS DEED ARE HEARD BY A JUDGE INA COURT PROCEEDING, AND NOT A JURY. GRANTEE AND GRANTOR AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE HEARD BY A JUDGE IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND NOT A JURY.
