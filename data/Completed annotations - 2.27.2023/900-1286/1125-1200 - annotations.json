A. Mineral Estate means all oil, gas, and other minerals in and under and that may be produced from the Property, any royalty under any existing or future mineral lease covering any part of the Property, executive rights (including the right to sign a mineral lease covering any part of the Property), implied rights of ingress and egress, exploration and development rights, production and drilling rights, mineral lease payments, and all related rights and benefits. The Mineral Estate does NOT include water, sand, gravel, limestone, building stone, caliche, surface shale, near-surface lignite, and iron, but DOES include the reasonable use of these surface materials for mining, drilling, exploring, operating, developing, or removing the oil, gas, and other minerals from the Property.   B. Subject to Section C below, the Mineral Estate owned by Grantor, if any, will be conveyed unless reserved as follows (check one box only):   eo (1) Grantor reserves all of the Mineral Estate owned by Grantor. (2) Grantor reserves an undivided   interest in the Mineral Estate owned by Grantor.   NOTE: If Grantor does not own all of the Mineral Estate, Grantor reserves only this percentage or fraction of Grantors interest.   C, Grantor reserves and retains implied rights of ingress and egress and of reasonable use of the Property (including surface materials) for mining, drilling, exploring, operating. developing, or removing the oil, gas, and other minerals. NOTE: Surface rights that may be held by other owners of the Mineral Estate who are not parties to this transaction (including existing mineral lessees) will NOT be affected by Grantors election. Grantors failure to complete Section C will be deemed an election to convey all surface rights described herein.   D. }f Grantor does not reserve all of Grantors interest in the Mineral Estate, Grantor shall, within seven (7) days after the Effective Date, provide Grantee with the contact information of any existing mineral lessee known to Grantor.   IMPORTANT NOTICE: The Mineral Estate affects important rights, the full extent of which may be unknown to Grantor. A full examination of the title to the Property completed by an attorney with expertise in this area is the only proper means for determining title to the Mineral Estate with certainty. In addition, attempts to convey or reserve certain interest out of the Mineral Estate separately from other rights and benefits owned by Grantor may have unintended consequences. Precise contract language is essential to preventing disagreements between present and future owners of the Mineral Estate. If Grantor or Grantee has any questions about their respective rights and interests in the Mineral Estate and how such rights and interests may be affected by this contract, they are strongly encouraged to consult an attorney with expertise in this area,   CONSULT AN ATTORNEY BEFORE SIGNING: TREC rules prohibit real estate licensees from giving legal advice.
